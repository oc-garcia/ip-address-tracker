# IP Address Tracker

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/oc-garcia/ip-address-tracker.git`
2. Obtain an API key from [IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/pricing).
3. Open the `script.js` file and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
5. Enter an IP address to track and view the location and ISP information.
